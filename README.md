# Hi, I'm Marco 
**`Fullstack Web Developer 💻`**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marekmars/marekmars/master/gh-header-image-cropped.png">
I am a passionate and focused individual with a keen interest in software development and a growing foundation in training.
Committed to continuous learning and skill development, I actively stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I thrive both as a collaborative team member in agile projects and as a motivated self-starter capable of working under my initiative.
Currently, I am engaged in Astro projects and am actively developing web applications using Angular for the frontend, Tailwind for styling, and .NET for the backend.
